# roamjs-scripts
    
A series of developer utilities to help make Roam extensions that can be hosted on [RoamJS](https://roamjs.com). Documentation can be found [here](https://developer.roamjs.com/roamjs-scripts/roamjs-scripts).

### lambdas

Compiles the files in the `lambdas` directory and uploads to lambda functions of a similar name. These lambdas will serve as the backend of the extension. Please reach out before using this command, as its very opinionated towards my specific workflow at the moment.
